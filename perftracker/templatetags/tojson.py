    tags.  It accepts the same arguments and returns a JSON string.  Note that
    this is available in templates through the ``|tojson`` filter which will
    also mark the result as safe.  Due to how this function escapes certain
    characters this is safe even if used outside of ``<script>`` tags.

    The following characters are escaped in strings:

    -   ``<``
    -   ``>``
    -   ``&``
    -   ``'``

    This makes it safe to embed such strings in any place in HTML with the
    notable exception of double quoted attributes.  In that case single
    quote your attributes or HTML escape it in addition.
